  // The data will be returned as a String, which we then need to convert to a JSON Ojbect to parse

  /*First, create a new DynamicJson Document – the number that goes in the brackets here allocates memory on the Arduino for the data you download from the server
     Make sure you allocate enough memory for the JSON you want to download or your Arduino will crash and you will need to manually reset it
     To calculate the memory required, use your web browser to call the API by pasting your full GET request into the address bar,
     and then copy and past the response you get into the ArduinoJson Assistant on this page: https://arduinojson.org/v6/assistant/
     You can also use the ArduinoJson assistant to help you write code to parse your JSON – see pages 12 – 14 of the 'Parsing JSON' slides on Learn for an example */

  DynamicJsonDocument jsonBuffer(2048);
  deserializeJson(jsonBuffer, weatherForecast); // Next, copy the data in the String returned by the getJson function into a JSON Object
  JsonObject json = jsonBuffer.as<JsonObject>();

  // For this example, we are going to use the daily low temperature, daily high temperate and current temperature to control the movement of the Servo and brightness of the LED
  float tempLow = json["daily"]["data"][0]["temperatureLow"]; // Create a float to hold each value, and then extract it from the JSON Object
  float tempHigh = json["daily"]["data"][0]["temperatureHigh"];
  float temp = json["currently"]["temperature"];

  Serial.println("Low: " + String(tempLow) + ", High: " + String(tempHigh) + ", Current: " + String(temp)); // Print the values to the Serial port

  //This is where we call the functions that move the servo and change the brightness of the LED.
  moveServo(tempLow, tempHigh, temp); // call the moveServo function (on moveServo tab) to update the position of the Servo
  lightLed(tempLow, tempHigh, temp); // call the lightLed function (on lightLed tab) to adjust the brightness of the LED
